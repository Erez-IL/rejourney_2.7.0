===============

Hackbright Academy Final Project (May 2013): ReJourney! - a mobile app for Android

ReJourney! is an Android mobile app for photo capture and playback to make photocollages of your trips based on geolocation. Built with Cordova Phonegap API, Android SDK, Google Maps API, JavaScript, and JQuery.

PhoneGap is a free and open source framework to create mobile apps using standardized web APIs for mobile platforms using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


- This repo was created to convert the project from Cordova Phonegap 2.6 to Cordova Phonegap 2.7. The max function for datakbase index references is broken in 2.6. PHONEGAP FAIL!
